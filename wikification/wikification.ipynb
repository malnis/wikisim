    "# Wikification\n",
    "This notebook contains code for doing wikification, as well as evaluating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of our Wikification Method\n",
    "The following flowchart describes how our wikification method works without much technical detail.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19fInwE2C_fsAFiMNnIPe0cFldIHbJTHrXrLlLg6nbwI/pub?w=728&h=600\">\n",
    "<center><strong>Figure 1.</strong> A flowchart describing our wikification method at a relatively basic level.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "## With More Detail\n",
    "In reference to figure 1.:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.  Input Some Text\n",
    "Self explanatory, just feed into the wikifier some text that is desired to be wikified. In the evaluation part of our code, the text comes pre-split from the datasets. We either keep the text split to focus more on our wikification, or join the text with spaces to evaluate while taking our own mention extraction into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tokenize Text\n",
    "The text is tokenized by a [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) extension called [Solr Text Tagger](https://github.com/OpenSextant/SolrTextTagger), this tokenizer returns all potential mentions that it detects in the text. Our code is configured so that the tokenizer returns all overlaps. So if given the text: 'The United States of America', the tokenizer would return all of 'The United States', 'The United States of America', 'United States', and 'United States of America'. These overlaps are undesirable for our wikification purposes. However we choose to enable the overlaps so that we can obtain more potential mentions that we can deal with later more intelligently than the tokenizer can (without configuring it deeply). The overlaps are dealt with in the next step, though future work may make it better to deal with them later in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Remove Overlaps\n",
    "This part as-is is a work in progress. Currently our method is to first group all overlapping mentions into what we call overlap sets. Each overlap set is comprised of overlapping mentions that start at the same letter. The mention 'probability' of each mention is calculated at this time. The mention 'probability' is not truly a probability, it is defined as the amount of times the mention text is a mention in Wikipedia divided by the amount of documents it shows up in Wikipedia (it would be preferable to have the denominator be the total amount of times the mention text shows up in Wikipedia (to be an actual probability)). The mention with the highest 'probability' in each overlap set is the sole mention that is kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "There of-course may still be overlaps remaining at this point, now the residual overlaps are to be dealt with. It is important to note that for the following part, the mentions are stored in the order that they appear in the text, by their beginning letters'. When we say the first mention we mean the mention that appears first in the text, and by next mention we mean the mention that appears next in the text. To deal with the residual overlaps we call the first mention the anchor, and all of the next mentions that start before the anchor mention ends, all get grouped together with the anchor mention in an overlap set. Just like before the most 'probable' mention in this set is kept, all others are discarded from the original set. Once again the first mention that in the updated original set is selected as the anchor, the same process is repeated. If the overlap set only contains the anchor mention, the whole process is repeated on the next mention. This process is repeated until there is no next mention to go to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step needs more investigation, perhaps the first part does not even need to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Filter with POS Tags and Mention Probability\n",
    "We use [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/) to tag all of the mentions (though we should tag all of the text together to get more accurate results (update to come)). Using the POS tags helps us filter out bad mentions. Approximately 99% of all mentions in our datasets where either any type of noun, an adjective, or a cardinal number. The tags are displayed as 'NN', 'NNS', 'NNP', and 'NNPS' for nouns, 'JJ' for adjectives, and 'CD' for cardinal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to filtering with POS tags, we also filter out any mention that have a 'probability' of being a mention of less than 0.001.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Candidate Generation\n",
    "Now that the mentions are all extracted, we must generate a list of possible entities that each mention can refer to, we call these, entity candidates. To select n candidates, we first try selecting n/2 entities (Wikipedia page) that the given mention refers to most on Wikipedia. We refer to this measure as popularity. Once the n/2 most popular are selected, the remaining n/2 entities are selected based on the context similarity with other mentions in the same sentence. If selecting most popular fails to return n/2 results, we try selecting however many we need based on context. So if popularity returns 0 entities, we select n from the most contextual. This method of mixing popular and contextual candidates is called the hybrid method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hybrid method of candidate generation scores best on average on each of our datasets. Selecting candidates based on popularity alone initially seemed more promising, because it scored better on the largest dataset (wiki5000), thus giving an overall higher recall. But on each independent dataset, the popularity method only scored better on wiki5000, by about one percent, whereas other datasets scored worse, from 3 to 13 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Candidate Scoring\n",
    "For each mention, all of the candidates must be scored on some metric. The candidate with the best score will be selected as the proposed entity for the mention. All of these methods rely on basic scores such as the popularity of an entity given the mention, or some measure of similarity from the context of a mention to the document of a candidate. Individually some of these methods perform well on select datasets, but combined together using machine learning gives the best results overall. Using a learning to rank algorithm ([LambdaMART](https://github.com/jma127/pyltr)), we achieve a score better than any best idividual on each of our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Popularity\n",
    "This method simply chooses the most popular candidate (most popular as described in section 5. Candidate Generation). This method performs very well but is undesirable due to the fact that it is just blindly guessing, and could be horribly wrong in some cases. See [this comic](https://comic.hmp.is.it/comic/rainy-days/) for an example of someone who does not quite get this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context 1\n",
    "For this method, the sentence that contains the mention is extracted and called the context. The mention is removed from this context. We then use Solr to search for the most similar document (Wikipedia page) by searching in the document text field for the context, as well as searching in the document title field for the mention text. The set of documents that we are searching through in Solr is of-course limited to those that are the candidates of the mention. We do what is called boosting to make the results more weighted by the title field, the results from this are boosted by 1.35 (multiplied) on each document. The document with the highest score is deemed the most similar and is selected as the proposed entity for the mention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context 2\n",
    "This method is slightly similar to Context 1 as it also uses Solr and it uses the sentence as a context in the same way. The difference is that we use a different index for this method. The index for this method, rather than containing whole documents (Wikipedia pages), contains all instances of all mentions with the surrounding context of each mention as a record. For example, a record could be for the mention 'David', the record will also have n (5 in this example) words before the mention: 'is a soccer player named', n words after the mention: 'he played for Manchester United', the Wikipedia page that the mention is in, and the Wikipedia page that the mention refers to. Using this index we search in the collection of all records that have the mention refer our candidate, for each candidate. The n words before and after are searched in for our context sentence, whichever entity has the highest number of relevant examples is selected as the proposed entity for that mention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word2Vec\n",
    "For this method we have Word2Vec create a vector space model of concepts from a Wikipedia corpus. The entities, as well as regular words all have their own vector representation. To use this method, we select n words before and after the mention, and get the vector representation of each of these words. All of these vectors are added together to become a context vector. This context vector is compared to the vector representation of each of the candidates. The candidate vector that is most similar (by cosine similarity) to the context vector is selected as the proposed entity for the mention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coherence\n",
    "This method uses the reverse page rank algorithm to determine which combination of candidates from all mentions makes the most sense together. This method looks at the quality of all of the proposed entities from all mentions together, instead of individually selecting the proposed entity for each individual mention."
